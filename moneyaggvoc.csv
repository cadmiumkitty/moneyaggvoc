A harmonised definition of the money-issuing sector. It consists of those entities which issue liabilities with a high degree of moneyness to non-MFIs located in the euro area (excluding central government). This sector comprises MFIs resident in the euro area.
A harmonised definition of the money-holding sector, which comprises all non-MFIs resident in the euro area (except central government). In addition to households, non-financial corporations and financial institutions which are not MFIs are included, as well as state and local governments and social security funds. Central governments are considered to constitute a ""money-neutral"" sector, with one exception: central government liabilities with a monetary character (Post Office accounts, national savings accounts and Treasury accounts) are included as a special item in the definition of monetary aggregates.
The harmonised definitions of MFI liabilities categories. These make it possible to distinguish between MFI liabilities according to their degree of moneyness, while also taking into account the features of different financial systems.",

Depending on their degree of moneyness, such deposits can be converted into components of narrow money, but in some cases there may be restrictions involved, such as the need for advance notification, delays, penalties or fees. The definition of M2 reflects the particular interest in analysing and monitoring a monetary aggregate that, in addition to currency, consists of deposits which are liquid.",

Certain money market instruments, in particular money market fund (MMF) shares/units and repurchase agreements are included in this aggregate. A high degree of liquidity and price certainty make these instruments close substitutes for deposits. As a result of their inclusion, M3 is less affected by substitution between various liquid asset categories than narrower definitions of money, and is therefore more stable.",

M0 data differ from M4 and other balance sheet statistics because they were compiled as a monthly average of weekly observations. They also included all notes and coin in circulation, whereas M4 only includes those held by the non-bank non-building society private sector. ",
mav:mav017,skos:Concept,,,mav:scheme,mav:mav015,,,,,,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-m4-data,M2,Retail M4,"Retail M4 (or M2) comprises:

The M4 private sector's
holdings of sterling notes and coin; and
sterling denominated 'retail' deposits with UK MFIs.
As noted in the August 1992 Quarterly Bulletin (page 317), the definition of the deposits which, along with notes and coin, previously comprised M2 was altered with effect from the flow for December 1992.

Retail deposits are defined as deposits which arise from a customer's acceptance of an advertised rate (including nil) for a particular product, typically 'retail' deposits are taken in the reporters' branch networks. With effect from October 2007, there was a change in the treatment of non-interest bearing deposits (see Valuation and Breaks).

Acceptances
The treatment of bank acceptances changed in September 1997, and was backdated. Acceptances are still being reported off balance sheet by individual reporters, but in the aggregated accounts and monetary statistics they count as on balance sheet of the accepting reporters (i.e. reporters accepting a bill are regarded as having a liability to the bill's owner and a claim on the party whose bill has been accepted).

Other MFI deposits include all Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts (TESSAs) (until maturity in April 2004) and (cash) Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs).
Repos include sale and repurchase agreements against marketable securities of all kinds. An institution selling a security under a repo retains the security on its balance sheet and records a liability to the counterparty representing the cash received. Thus, a repo is a kind of secured deposit. The matching asset will depend on how the cash proceeds were employed. An institution acquiring a security under a reverse repo does not include the security on its balance sheet but records a claim on the counterparty representing the funds lent. The matching liability will depend on how the loan is funded.",
mav:mav018,skos:Concept,,,mav:scheme,mav:mav015,,,,,,https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-m4-data,M4,,"M4 comprises:

The M4 private sector's (i.e. the UK private sector other than monetary financial institutions (MFIs)) holdings of: 
sterling notes and coin;
sterling deposits, including certificates of deposit; 
commercial paper, bonds, FRNs and other instruments of up to and including five years' original maturity issued by UK MFIs;
claims on UK MFIs arising from repos (from December 1995);
estimated holdings of sterling bank bills;

and

35% of the sterling inter-MFI difference (added to OFC deposits, within wholesale M4). For further details please see the September 2011 Statistics article ‘Estimation and allocation methods within money and credit data’. Prior to September 2011, 95% of the domestic sterling interbank (now inter-MFI) difference was allocated to OFC deposits, the remaining 5% being allocated to transits. This followed a review of its causes (see page 101 of the June 1992 Economic Trends).
The sectoral distribution of holdings of CDs cannot be fully identified; errors may affect M4 itself, as well as its sectoral analysis.

Seasonally adjusted quarterly M4 is calculated as households' M4 (seasonally adjusted) plus PNFCs' M4 (seasonally adjusted) plus OFCs M4 (seasonally adjusted). More details are available in the Statistics article Seasonal adjustment of quarterly M4 excluding intermediate OFCs (M4ex) published in September 2010. Following a review of the seasonal adjustment method for non-intermediate OFCs once a sufficient run of monthly data was available, changes were made to the seasonally adjusted measures of M4 and M4 lending to bring them into line with the usual approach. The changes are detailed in the October 2013 Statistics article, ‘Modifications to the seasonally adjusted measures of M4 and M4 lending excluding intermediate OFCs’. ",

This encompasses also two narrower aggregates, M1 and M2.

Euro-area M3 is made up of monetary liabilities of euro-area monetary financial institutions (MFIs) and central government (Debt Management Office) vis-à-vis non-MFI euro-area residents excluding central government, in all currencies:

currency in circulation (M1)
overnight deposits (M1)
deposits with agreed maturity up to two years (M2)
deposits redeemable at notice up to three months (M2)
repurchase agreements
money market fund shares/units and money market paper
debt securities up to two years.
The estimate of M3 we compile for the UK is made up of monetary liabilities of MFIs in the UK vis-à-vis non-MFI UK residents excluding central government, in all currencies. The UK reporting system does not currently identify the maturity breakdowns used in the euro-area definition. These are therefore estimated.

The euro-area aggregate does not include the adjustments for transit items and the inter-MFI reporting difference, which are made for UK M4. A reconciliation table which illustrates the differences between M4 and this estimate of M3 is available on request.

These data therefore provide an estimate of M3 for the UK. These data replaced the M3H European harmonised aggregate, which was previously published to facilitate international comparisons between EU member states.

M3H comprised the components of M4 plus:

foreign currency deposits held by the M4 private sector with MFIs in the UK
sterling and foreign currency deposits held by UK public corporations with MFIs in the UK.
For further information on the compilation of these aggregates see the Statistics article 'Euro area monetary aggregates and their role in the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy' in the ECB's Monthly Bulletin.",
