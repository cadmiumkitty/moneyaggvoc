With effect from October 2007, there was a change in the treatment of non-interest bearing deposits (see Valuation and Breaks).\\n\\nAcceptances\\nThe treatment of bank acceptances changed in September 1997, and was backdated. Acceptances are still being reported off balance sheet by individual reporters, but in the aggregated accounts and monetary statistics they count as on balance sheet of the accepting reporters (i.e. reporters accepting a bill are regarded as having a liability to the bill\\'s owner and a claim on the party whose bill has been accepted).\\n\\nOther MFI deposits include all Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts (TESSAs) (until maturity in April 2004) and (cash) Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs).\\nRepos include sale and repurchase agreements against marketable securities of all kinds. An institution selling a security under a repo retains the security on its balance sheet and records a liability to the counterparty representing the cash received. Thus, a repo is a kind of secured deposit. The matching asset will depend on how the cash proceeds were employed. An institution acquiring a security under a reverse repo does not include the security on its balance sheet but records a claim on the counterparty representing the funds lent. The matching liability will depend on how the loan is funded.\"\"\" ;\\n    skos:inScheme mav:scheme ;\\n    skos:prefLabel \"M2\" .\\n\\nmav:mav018 a skos:Concept ;\\n    dcterms:source <https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-m4-data> ;\\n    skos:broader mav:mav015 ;\\n    skos:definition \"\"\"M4 comprises:\\n\\nThe M4 private sector\\'s (i.e. the UK private sector other than monetary financial institutions (MFIs)) holdings of: \\nsterling notes and coin;\\nsterling deposits, including certificates of deposit; \\ncommercial paper, bonds, FRNs and other instruments of up to and including five years\\' original maturity issued by UK MFIs;\\nclaims on UK MFIs arising from repos (from December 1995);\\nestimated holdings of sterling bank bills;\\n\\nand\\n\\n35% of the sterling inter-MFI difference (added to OFC deposits, within wholesale M4).
